#Strings
#A string can be created using two single or double quotation marks " , " ','
#All number in quotes are string
print('Hi there')
# \ Backslash: escape character. Used in string. Used for new lines, tabs, other stuff
print('Brian\'s mother: He\'s not an angel. He\'s a very naughty boy!')
print('I\'m learning!')
print("He said:\"cool!\".")
#\n creates a new line
print('One \nTwo \nThree')
# \t creates a new tab
print("\t hey \t there")
# \r is the carriage return symbol. It shifts the cursor to the beginning of the line
#But it may not work as well in all Python enviornments
print('\tHeyyo \r there')
#Okay so apparently, the /r by itself outputs "   there" but with \t in front of the Heyyo, it works as expected
#Use a double backslash \\ to escape
print("Newline is \\n")
#Windows used \r\n for enter key, Linux and Unix use \n
#Newlines can also be automatically added by using triple quotes
print("""this
is a 
multiline
text""")
#triple quotes do not need to be escaped 
print("""
I'm learning.
Python's syntax is easy
""")
#Concatenation is for adding strings
print("Spam"+"eggs")
print("Python"+"rocks")
#Numbers will stil be added as string! Don't add it to an integer, which will cause code issues
print("2" + "2")
#Multiplying a string by an integer repeats the original string, but multiplying string * string or string*float produces an error
print("spam"*3)
print(4*'2')
# variable values can be reassigned but this should generally be avoided
x=123.456
print(x)
x="This is a string"

#del statement can remove a variable. Using the deleted variable yields an error unless it is reassigned
x=42

#Input() promptes the user for input then returns a string
